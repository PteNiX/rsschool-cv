     Before I decided to apply for js-developer I have read two books: R.Savin “тестирование.com” and S.Kulikov “Тестирование программного обеспечения. Базовый курс”.  Besides, I have  finished the course by javaScript here https://learn.javascript.ru/. In addition, I have learned HTML and CSS here https://htmlacademy.ru/. Moreover I everyday improve my English level using paper books and some mobile application such as dualingo etc. At home I have five various devices which working on ios, android and windows.
